                <p>Clipboard Plus is a Windows utility to view and manage the
                  Windows clipboard.</p>
                <p>It maintains and can display up to five copied items or
                  clips. Clips are arranged from newest to oldest.</p>
                <p>Clicking on a clip loads it back into the clipboard and it is
                  ready for pasting into another application. It also now
                  becomes the latest clip, and other clips scroll down.</p>
                   <p>It has a built in Sticky Note tool in which the clips can be stored, 
                   notes can be added and reminders can be set.</p>
                   <p>The stored clips persist between reboots.</p>
               <p>To explore more features and functions of this utility, right
                  click on it.</p>
                <p>This tiny but useful utility is completely free and open
                  sourced. For more such amazing free apps please visit the
                  links on the left.</p>

                  <p>Note: The installer will optionally add a shortcut to the
                    startup folder of Windows, so that Clipboard Plus starts
                    automatically when you start Windows. This is enabled by
                    default. You can remove the shortcut from the startup folder if needed.</p>

                <p>Copy content as usual from any window using Control-C or
                  Control-X or context menu. The clip will appear in the

                  any entry in the list to load it in the Windows Clipboard.
                  Paste it anywhere you like. Whenever you copy something, the
                  top most clip will be updated and the old clips scroll down.</p>

              <h3 id="Reminders">Reminders</h3>

              Sticky Clips in Clipboard Plus has a neat feature to remind you for something important.
                Just type in your note and prefix it with the set reminder
                command and time. For example:<br>
                <strong><br>
                  set reminder 11:30 call someone<br>
                  set reminder 2h 15m go jogging and drop trash<br>
                </strong><strong>set reminder 20m Skype meeting with client<br>
                  <br>
                </strong>Press Tick (✓) button to set a reminder as above.<br>
                <br>
                You should see an ack message showing some details. This is also
                saved as a sticky clip for later use. The reminder is a one
                time reminder, it won't keep repeating.<br>
                 <br>
                <img src="images/ssremack.png" alt="rem ack screen shot"><br>
                <br>
     
                As you must have noticed, there are two ways to specify the
                time. Either as HH:MM, in which case the reminder sounds exactly
                at that time, or as a duration as xxh yym, in which case the
                reminder sounds exactly after that duration.<br>
                <br>
                <div class="noticebox">
                  <p>Note: Its a bit sensitive about syntax. So do not add words
                    between set reminder and time or do not use words instead of
                    numbers while mentioning time. Do not use AM or PM. It works in 24 hr format.</p>
                  <p>You cannot set a reminder for next day or next week.
                    However, when you use the duration, it may cross over to the
                    next day.</p>
                </div>
                &nbsp;
                <div class="noticebox">
                  <p><span style="color: red;">Warning: </span>This is not a
                    Windows scheduler event or OS level alarm. If you exit
                    ClipBoard Plus, you will never get reminded. Closing and
                    restarting ClipBoard Plus has the same effect. Reminders are
                    timer based, they are not retained (As for version 1.1.0).</p>
                    <p>You can set up to 20 reminders. The 21st reminder will overwrite the first and so on.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="noticebox">
                  <p>Note: The reminder appears as a message box. If your text
                    is too long, it gets truncated. But you can view the full
                    text in sticky clips.</p>
                  <p>If you are not happy with the voice that announces the
                    reminder, you can replace it with your own jingle or sound
