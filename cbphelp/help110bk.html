                <h3>Installation</h3>
                <p>Download the Windows Installer from: <a href="https://github.com/oormicreations/ClipboardPlus/releases"

                    target="_blank">GitHub</a></p>
                <p>Unzip the downloaded file and run setup.exe.</p>
                <p>Follow the instructions. Run the program from start menu or
                  by double clicking Clipboard Plus desktop icon.</p>
                <div class="b2bdetail">
                  <p>Note: The installer will optionally add a shortcut to the
                    startup folder of Windows, so that Clipboard Plus starts
                    automatically when you start Windows. This is enabled by
                    default. Disabled the auto startup by unchecking the related
                    checkbox on the last screen of the installer.</p>

                <p>Copy content as usual from any window using Control-C or
                  Control-X or context menu. The clip will appear in the
                  Clipboard Plus list. Copy more to add to the list. Click on
                  any entry in the list to load it in the Windows Clipboard.
                  Paste it anywhere you like. Whenever you copy something, the
                  top most clip will be updated and the old clips scroll down.</p>
                <div class="b2bdetail">
                  <p>Note: Only text clips are supported.</p>

                <div class="b2bdetail">

                  in your default browser.</p>
                <p><strong>Password Mode:</strong> Enable or disable password
                  mode. When enabled, it masks the copied passwords.</p>
                <div class="b2bdetail">
                  <p>Note: A password must have combination of letters, numbers

                  <p>A clip with spaces or with length greater than 16
                    characters is not considered as a password.</p>
                  <p>This feature is language dependent. Currently only English

                    casual onlooker is not able to see it.</p>

              <td>It has a neat feature to remind you for something important.
                Just type in your note and prefix it with the set reminder
                command and time. For example:<br>
                <strong><br>
                  set reminder 11:30 call someone<br>
                  set reminder 2h 15m go jogging and drop trash<br>
                </strong><strong>set reminder 20m Skype meeting with client<br>
                  <br>
                </strong>Press Add (+) button to set a reminder as above.<br>
                <br>
                You should see an ack message showing some details. This is also
                saved as a sticky clip for later use. The reminder is a one
                time reminder, it won't keep repeating.<br>
                <br>
                As you must have noticed, there are two ways to specify the
                time. Either as HH:MM, in which case the reminder sounds exactly
                at that time, or as a duration as xxh yym, in which case the
                reminder sounds exactly after that duration.<br>
                <br>
                <div class="b2bdetail">
                  <p>Note: Its a bit sensitive about syntax. So do not add words
                    between set reminder and time or do not use words instead of
                    numbers while mentioning time. Do not use AM or PM. It works in 24 hr format.</p>
                  <p>You cannot set a reminder for next day or next week.
                    However, when you use the duration, it may cross over to the
                    next day.</p>
